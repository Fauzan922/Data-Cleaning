# Data Cleaning and Data Preparation
This repository includes a collection of RStudio and Python scripts designed for data cleaning and preparation, with a focus on satellite imagery data.

In here, you can look for data cleaning script that maybe you can use into your project, because i build this because i also use this script before, so i compile it in here, so other people can also use it. I will also update it by everytime i met by some problem while managing and cleaning data.
